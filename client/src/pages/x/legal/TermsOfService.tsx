          <p>
            Trading cryptocurrencies and using automated trading bots involves substantial risk. 
            You should carefully consider whether trading is suitable for you, your wallet, 
            your sanity, and your ability to explain losses to your significant other. 💔
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-[#b8eaff]">
            Side effects may include: checking charts every 5 minutes, using phrases like "diamond hands" 
            unironically, and developing an unhealthy relationship with candlestick patterns. 📊💕
